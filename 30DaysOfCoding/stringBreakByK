Given a string, s, and an integer, k.
---

Break up the string into multiple texts such that each text has a length of k or less.
---

You must break it up so that words don't break across lines.
---

If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.
---
You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.

Test:  "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10

Answer: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]

---

One Approach:
Break up the words by spaces.
Add the string by length < k
If end of iteration, add remainder
If not possible, return null.
