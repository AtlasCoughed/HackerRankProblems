What are geocodes?

GPS Coordinates. 
Interpolate a location's geocoordinates by using math to approximate its position.

Geocoding is converting a location's description (format: address) to specific GPS coordinates.

1. Most accurate way -> Go to location, take GPS location (lat/long)

2. Interpolation slightly less accurate. 
  Ex.) Take a random street. We have two pre-existing geocodes that are in close proximity to the addresse on  the street we want to know about.
  Let's just say they are on either side of the street. We can use math to determine the middle.
