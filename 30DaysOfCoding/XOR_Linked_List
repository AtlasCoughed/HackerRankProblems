An XOR linked list is a more memory effcient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is a XOR of the next node and the previous node.

Implement a XOR linked List; it has an add (element) which adds the element to the end, and get (index) which returns the node at index.

// Javascript does not have the use of pointers but for the use of this problem, we should have the methods:

// - get_pointer - converts nodes -> memory address
// - deference_pointer - converts memory address -> nodes
