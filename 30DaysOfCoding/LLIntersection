Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
Return the insecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value.

That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node by reference as the jth node of the second linked list then they 
are intersecting.

Thought Process:
// 1.) Figure out length and tails
// 2.) if tails are not the same, return false
// 3.) trim the longest link list from end
// 4.) iterate through and find if itersection
