Kubernetes - container infrastracture

Hadoop

App Engine -> Platform as a service (use of VMs)


GCP -
open source convertible
-> Not trapped into one vendor

Kubernetes - ability to mix and match various microservices across different cloud providers

Stackdriver - manages and monitor across different cloud

-----

GCP - build test and deploy the cloud
